# PromptHub: Your AI Prompt Management Tool

[中文文档](README_CN.md) 

## Introduction

In the world of AI application development, prompts are not just the bridge between human language and machine intelligence, but an indispensable component of modern intelligent applications. PromptHub is designed to provide developers with a simple, lightweight, and easily integrated management system to effectively manage, optimize, and expand your prompt applications, just like GitHub in the prompt domain.

## Features
- **User-Friendly API/SDK**: With a visual UI and straightforward API/SDK, PromptHub offers developers a seamless integration experience.
- **Decoupling Code and Prompts**: Focused on separating prompts from code logic, providing stable infrastructure support for production environments.
- **Support for Multiple Models**: Allows specifying the applicable AI models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5) to optimize costs according to needs.
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Supports customizing the output format of prompts (JSON or String) to meet the requirements of different scenarios.
- **One-Stop Management**: Centralize the management of prompts across multiple projects, improving efficiency.
- **Version Control**: Supports saving versions of prompts, convenient for A/B testing and quick rollbacks (planned).
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilizes models like GPT-4 to optimize the format and content of prompts, increasing accuracy while reducing token usage to save costs (planned).
